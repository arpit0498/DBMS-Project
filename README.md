<b>WholeSaler</b>

This is a project that I did as part of the "Database Systems" course laboratory in my 5th semester during undergrad. I developed a " WholeSaler" web app through which wholesaler perform various actions like add and delete ( products,customers & stock) through simple web interface.  A customer can check the available stock present.

1. Backend (Database): MySQL version 5.7
2. Frontend (Web Technologies): HTML5 and PHP5
3. The web server was hosted using XAMPP v3.2.2
